Monte Carlo Simulation of Compton Scattering

Based on Klein-Nishina cross section.

CPassThrough CPTBrutal: Compton scattering from a pass through geometry, normal and brutal force version. There two should yield the same scattering cross section
CPassThrough2D: pass through version, but all angular position intensities collected.

CRefBuried : reflectivity geometry, for a buried interface
